## Breakdown

| Letter | Word | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Qu** | **Qu**ery | Query execution and planning |
| **I** | **I**ndex | Document indexing and storage |
| **D** | **D**istributed | Distributed cluster architecture |
| **D** | **D**ata | Data management and processing |
| **I** | **I**nfrastructure | Complete search infrastructure |
| **T** | **T**ext | Full-text search capabilities |
| **C** | **C**lustering | Distributed node coordination |
| **H** | **H**igh-performance | SIMD acceleration, C++ core |

---

## Rationale

The name **QUIDDITCH** captures the core capabilities of the project:

1. **Query and Index** - The two fundamental operations of any search engine
2. **Distributed Data Infrastructure** - Emphasizes the distributed, scalable architecture
3. **Text search** - Core feature: full-text search with BM25 ranking
4. **Clustering** - Raft-based consensus and node coordination
5. **High-performance** - Diagon C++ core with SIMD acceleration

---

## Elevator Pitch

> **QUIDDITCH** is a distributed search engine that provides OpenSearch API compatibility while leveraging a high-performance C++ core (Diagon) for indexing and query execution. It features a distributed cluster architecture with specialized node types, Python-first pipeline framework, and PPL query language support.

## Origin Story

The project needed a memorable name that reflected its technical capabilities. **QUIDDITCH** was chosen because:

1. **Memorable** - Easy to remember and pronounce
2. **Distinctive** - Stands out in the search engine landscape
3. **Meaningful** - The backronym accurately describes the system
4. **Fun** - Adds personality while remaining professional

The name also subtly references the fast-paced, multi-player nature of the game - paralleling the distributed, high-performance nature of the system.

- **Quidditch Master Node** - Cluster coordination and consensus
- **Quidditch Data Node** - Index storage and query execution
- **Quidditch Coordinator Node** - REST API and request routing

## Pronunciation

**KWIH-ditch** (/'kwɪdɪtʃ/)

Same as the fictional sport from Harry Potter, but with a technical backronym that makes it stand apart.
